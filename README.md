# School_District_Analysis Written Report

This analysis starts with importing the two CVS files into the Jupyter notebook. We were asked to complete two deliverables, the first was to replace math scores and ninth grade reading scores.The second deliverable was to repeat the school district analysis. The first deliverable was to see our understanding of the loc method. The first step, we loc the 9th grade students. In the following two steps, we replace the grades for 9th graders to "NaN" for both math and reading. The last step was to use student_data_df.tail(10) and with this we are able to see all the replacements that have been made.
